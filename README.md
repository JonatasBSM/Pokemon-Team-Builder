# Pokemon-Team-Builder

## What is it?
- It will be a web application with different tools to help in Pokemon Team Building process. Right now, the only tool is a table that helps seeing your team defensive
coverage.

Don't bother about that white text on the right bottom side, it's just the Windows Activation Alert lol

## What's next?
- I'll definitely add a Damage Calculator and probably a smart team builder helper, that will show the best pokemon options to complete your team (i'll probably change
 design too lol). Here's a video of the actual tool (fome some reason the input list options we're not recorded and i still don't know how to do it).
